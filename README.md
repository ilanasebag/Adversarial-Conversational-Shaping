# Adversarial Conversational Shaping : Intelligent Chatting Agent 

In this repository, my team and I explored Conversational Shaping with the brand new T5 Transformers from HuggingFace using GANs in a Reinforcement Learning framework. T5 is an encoder-decoder model [1] pretrained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks and reads every text processing problem as a text-to-text problem. 

The repository consits of our submission for the final group work for the Statistical Natural Language Processing (COMP0087) at UCL taught by Facebook AI Research and contains : 

- The paper 
- An explanatory video of the porject
- A demonstration notebook
- The code
